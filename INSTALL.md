#Installation

The injectionproxy.js was developed on Node.js v0.12.0, but also tested successfully under node 0.10.36. There is an incompatibility with io.js 1.6.x though since iconv does not yet compile on io.js. To install the required modules issue the following command in the root folder of the project:

```
npm install colors dateformat iconv mootools
```
